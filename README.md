This is where I'll be tracking the build of the headphone tube amp. More documentation on [jpreardon.com](http://jpreardon.com/tag/headphone-amp/)


## Research

- The [NP-100v12: 12AU7 (ECC82) / IRF510 Headphone Amp](http://diyaudioprojects.com/Solid/12AU7-IRF510-LM317-Headamp/) was referenced on [this instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Class-A-Hybrid-Headphone-Amp/?ALLSTEPS). *This one seems to be pretty simple, only uses one tube and may be a great project to start with.*
- [Starving Student](http://www.pmillett.com/starving.htm) *Apparently the 19J6 tubes are a bit harder to come by than some others. There are some modifications that use more readily available tubes though. There is also a warning about this amp potentially frying two types of DACs.*
- [Millett MAX](http://www.pmillett.com/hybrid_head.htm) ([more info at diyforums](http://www.diyforums.org/MAX/MAXoverview.php)) *Both the Millett Max amps have higher part counts than the previously listed amps.*
