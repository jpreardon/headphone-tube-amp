# Project Log

### 2015-12-26

I spent most of the day working on finishing this project. I started by getting all of the enclosure components wired and soldered. Soldering is a joy, by the way, with my new solder station--a christmas gift from my wife.

I'm pretty slow with the soldering and wiring. I also made some stupid mistakes, even after I drew my crude schematic. I did test the power as well as the bypass circuit before proceeding.

The perfboard took forever. I only had to desolder two components where I made mistakes (so far). This is reaffirming my hatred of perfboard. I hope this thing fires up on the first try, because trouble shooting is going to be difficult, if not impossible.

Next step is connecting the tube socket. That should be relatively quick. Fingers crossed that it works once everyting is wired.

### 2016-12-18

All the additional parts came yesterday. I'm going to try soldering up a perfboard for this, even though I've had less than stellar results with perfboard in the past. Here's my reasoning:

- I have some 2x3 perfboard on hand
- It should fit on the 2x3 perf board since the board layout is only slightly larger, but I'm not putting the tube on the board.
- I have none of the PCB supplies on hand to etch/drill a PCB

I got all the parts to fit in the enclosure, including the perf board, and drilled a bunch of vent holes. I had to dremel the back of the panel around the potentiometer hole so the nut would grab on the front. I also had to make a sort of countersink hole for the input jack.

Updated templates for all the holes are in the repository here.

I was going to try cutting a hole in the top to mount the tube in a more secure fashion, but I'm not sure that's going to work given the holes I've already drilled. I might just mount a socket with hot glue or something.

I had a hard time getting the barrel plug soldered on to the power supply. I broke one of them. Then, I realized the plug's not long enough anyway. I ordered some more, I hope they aren't too long.

Ok, it's time to think about finishing this thing up. In order for this enclosure to work, we need a few more things:

** All panel mount components need long shafts for this enclosure. Although, I might try to shave a bit off the inside for the pot and the 1/4" jack in order to use what I have.

#### Part 1

After organizing the components and studying the schematic a bit more, I realized I was missing a couple 1/2 watt resistors (they were 1/4 watt on the BOM, but 1/2 on the schematic). Luckily, Radio Shack had some. While I was there, I also picked up a couple 1/8" jacks for input.

I started mounting the output jack and the potentiometer on the enclosure. Unfortunately, they don't project enough through the case. The jack just catches the nut, but only by a thread or two. The, pot, no way, even after I broke off the tab used to keep it from rotating :) More about the pot later.

Here's what it looks like so far.

![enclosure front](https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s1080x1080/e15/fr/15251777_967469766688077_6027269915923185664_n.jpg)

I think the only other thing going on the front is a small power switch, and maybe a power LED. The switch will probably go right over the sticker.

I soldered some wires on the jacks and the pot. I tested it out with some headphones to make sure it worked as expected. It did, but it seems like this pot might be kind of shitty. It cuts out a little near the max. It needs to get replaced with one with a longer shaft anyway, so not a big deal.

### Part 2

I connected everything up, was happy to see the heaters glow when I plugged it in. I set the bias and checked the DC offset. I noticed that the offset was a little high on the right channel (~14 mv as opposed to the < 10mv I was expecting, the left channel was around 7.5 mv).

I tested with some cheap earbuds and was happy to actually hear music! I plugged in some better headphones and listened to some music:

- Sharon Jones & The Dap Kings: What if We All Stopped Paying Taxes
- Sex Pistols: Sub-Mission
- Rush: Tom Sawyer

Sounds great! It is bright, as others have reported. There is a low level hiss, which is only noticeable when there is no sound. I'll have to see what I can do to get rid of that. It also picks up some RFI, most noticeable if an iPhone is a foot or so away from the circuitry.

Now I guess I need to make a board for this thing and put it in the case.

There's a picture of the [working, and messy, circuit on my blog](http://jpreardon.com/2016/12/11/cold-evening-warmed-gentle-glow-12au7-tube/).

### 2016-12-06

Tubes came in yesterday, and the rest of the parts today. Power supplies shipped today as well.

Since the tube isn't going to fit so well on the breadboard, I was looking for a way to wire it up temporarily so it isn't flopping around. I found this a  cigar box in my small junk collection. I think I "borrowed" it from Carl's shop a couple years ago. Anyway, I drilled some holes in the sliding cover, and mounted the tube socket along with some wires that I will hook up later. The wires were a mess, so I labeled all of them.

Even though it is meant to be temporary, I guess this little cigar box could function as a more permanent enclosure. It will need some ventilation holes in it though.

I put [some pictures](http://jpreardon.com/2016/12/06/temporary-amp-enclosure/) on my blog.

### 2016-11-30

Putting together shopping list. I'm going to put this together on a breadboard first, so I'll skip the enclosure and PCB stuff for now.

### 2016-11-28

Spent some time reading over the [project page](http://diyaudioprojects.com/Solid/12AU7-IRF510-LM317-Headamp/) in detail.

Researched PCB fabrication

- [This one](http://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-Consistent-Cheap-Toner-Transfer-Method-for-Si/?ALLSTEPS) requires a laminator.
- I saw another tutorial using toner transfer that looked like a huge pain in the ass, due partly to the heavy, glossy printer paper used. The one above certainly seemed better.
- I liked [Colin's](http://www.jameco.com/Jameco/workshop/video/make-learn-to-etch-cicuit-board-with-collin-cunningham.html) tutorial, which uses photoresist.
- There's some talk [here](http://www.diystompboxes.com/smfforum/index.php?topic=99788.0) about liquid tinning, I think I'd like to do that.
