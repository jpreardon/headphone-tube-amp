Spent some time reading over the [project page](http://diyaudioprojects.com/Solid/12AU7-IRF510-LM317-Headamp/) in detail.

Researched PCB fabrication

- [This one](http://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-Consistent-Cheap-Toner-Transfer-Method-for-Si/?ALLSTEPS) requires a laminator.
- I saw another tutorial using toner transfer that looked like a huge pain in the ass, due partly to the heavy, glossy printer paper used. The one above certainly seemed better.
- I liked [Colin's](http://www.jameco.com/Jameco/workshop/video/make-learn-to-etch-cicuit-board-with-collin-cunningham.html) tutorial, which uses photoresist.
- There's some talk [here](http://www.diystompboxes.com/smfforum/index.php?topic=99788.0) about liquid tinning, I think I'd like to do that.
